# Copilot / AI Rules

- One PR = one goal.
- Keep diffs small; avoid unrelated edits.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.

AI usage:
- Ask for file-scoped changes.
- Require explanation: what changed and why.
- Verify with tests/CI.

Security:
- Never commit secrets.
- Extra scrutiny for auth, permissions, payments, wallet keys/signing.
